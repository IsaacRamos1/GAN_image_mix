# GAN_image_mix

Hello, as i said, i searched ways to do this and i saw the brilliant job[1][2] about put two images together and throught in a especial neural network (Generated Adversarial Network (GAN)) i got some extraordinary results training with two images. I separated in style-image and base-image.

ps.:the code it's not avaiable because i don't wat cause any trouble with author's rights, i have to study every single line to understand 100% (guess i'm with 60% lol) and i'll be open for you guys, sorry about that.

the final image contains the original, the GAN's output and her with 2 bonus effects:
